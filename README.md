# Fluentify: Node.js, Express, TS, Postgre SQL, Redis, Next.js 15

## Application Description ðŸ“‹
This platform is a comprehensive solution for learning languages, powered by AI. It's also my most ambitious full-stack project to date, with my primary focus being on the backend so far.

Currently, the app supports learning English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, and potentially more languages in the future.

The standout feature of the platform is the AI tutor, which offers low-latency audio conversations. It enables users to both send voice messages and receive spoken responses, creating an immersive and interactive learning experience.

## Key features ðŸ”‘: (Already implemented)
- Voice AI Responses â€“ Enables spoken feedback with low latency (not yet real-time, but improving this is a future goal).
- Customizable Tutor Profiles â€“ Choose the tutorâ€™s accent, origin, and language proficiency level (aligned with CEFR standards)
- Vocabulary Learning â€“ Leverages flashcard sets for effective vocabulary acquisition.
- Authentication â€“ Secure login via OAuth with session management powered by Redis.
- Vocabulary Management â€“ Full CRUD functionality for creating and managing vocabulary sets.
- Flashcard Management â€“ Full CRUD functionality for flashcards.
